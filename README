============================= G A M E - R U L E S =============================
In Bubble Trouble your goal is to pop all the balls in each level without getting
hit by the balls. In our version we actualized the normal game + survival mode.
Normal: you can either play SOLO or DUO (same PC or online), play along the levels
	and win, when you pop a ball you got a chance of getting a gift, each time you 
	get hit by ball the level will reset and you'll lose 1 life, when the lives
	end the game will be over.

Survival: 1 endless level without any walls (so you can go in either direction 
	for ever) and the balls spawn on you infinitely the game is over when you lose
	all the lives. In this mode you can only play SOLO

Level Creator: you can create your own levels and play them, just click save and
	reload the game and the level will be waiting for you (last one).
	you can choose which balls to put (8 - smallest, 0 - biggest) which direction
	they'll go, choose to add walls or floors.

================================ O B J E C T S ================================
Ball	- The player needs to shoot ropes at the ball to make it split into 2 smaller balls. 
				The ball disappears if small enough when hit.
				If hits the player the lives decrease. If hit there is a chance for a gift to appear.

Bear	- The object which represents the player. The player can control it, shoot from it and avoid the balls.
				If collided with a ball the lives decrease or transfers back to the menu if 0 lives reached.
				Can collide with gifts which will give the player more lives, power-ups etc.

Rope	- The object the player shoots the balls with. Disappears once hit a ball or tile. Can be frozen in place until
				collided with ball if player acquired the freeze gift.

Tile	- The walls, defines the borders. Balls can't move through them.

Button	- The player will see buttons when in the menu. Will need to press some of them to reach the level creator
				or the survival/normal game-modes. Required to be pressed if one wishes to start the game.

Gift	- Will appear at random when the player hits balls. There are gifts of freeze rope, add time, add additional rope to be shot
				simultaneously by the same player, add lives.
